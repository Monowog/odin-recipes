        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and after trying <em>this</em> preparation of oatmeal, I most certainly agree.
        </p>

        <p>

            Rolled oats are not only a great source of fiber and a hearty breakfast option, but they also function as a <strong>phenomenal</strong> conduit for antioxidant-rich berries! 
            The best part: with all of this fruit in the mix, there's no need for any added sugar! If the bananas are ripe enough, they should have <em>plenty</em> of sweetness to go around.

        </p>
